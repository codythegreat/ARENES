### ARENES (Another Redundant Emulator for the NES)

ARENES (Pronounced are-nes) is a nes emulator based on OneLoneCoder's implementation in C++ (You can find that here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES/)

ARENES is really nothing more than a presonal fun project, but I'm planning on taking some deviations from OLC's project (This is written in C instead of C++, and this will also implement some of the illegal opcodes of the 6502)

### Goals

Current goals include:

+ completion of 6502 emulator `[ ]`
+ completion unit testing for 6502 emulator `[ ]`
+ logging mode of 6502 emulator `[ ]`

### Contributing

If you'd like to contribute please do so :) I'm going to try an include as much information as I can inside the source files. I'll also upload my personal notes on the project in PDF format.

### License

Since this code is by and large influenced by OLC, I'll be including his copyright notice:
